# Vampire: The Masquerade Fifth Edition Online Resonance Generator
## What is it?
This app simulates resonance acquired from hunting and feeding in the VTM V5 tabletop RPG ruleset, built on Angular and Bootstrap.
## Why?
For a while, my coterie wasn't actually in need of anything like this- coincidentally, everyone was a bagger or farmer (ethical vampirism gang). Recently, though, in a different chronicle, we realized how useful something like this would be since we were actually feeding off of vessels with resonance all the time.
## What can it do?
You can randomly roll or select one of the 4 humors of resonance given in the VTM V5 core book, and roll for the intensity of that resonance (none, fleeting, intense, acute). The app displays the effects of those intensities when one is rolled. There are two probability options for rolling intensities- the standard spread given in the core rulebook (1-5 none, 6-8 fleeting, 9-0 roll again + 1-8 intense, 9-0 acute) and my table's own house rules spread, since we prefer a higher chance of the additional effects from intense/acute resonances (1-4 none, 5-7 fleeting, 8-0 roll again + 1-6 intense, 7-0 acute) Additionally, if an acute resonance is rolled, the app will generate a corresponding random dyscrasia from the list of sample dyscrasias from the core rulebook, and display its description.
